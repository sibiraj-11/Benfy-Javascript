// The confirm() method displays a dialog box with a specified message, along with an OK and a Cancel button. A confirm box is often used to ask permission from a user to execute something. Window confirm() takes a string as an argument. Clicking the OK yields true value, whereas clicking the Cancel button yields false value.
const agree = confirm('Are you sure you like to delete? ')
console.log(agree) // result will be true or false based on what you click on the dialog box
