// Primitive data types are immutable(non-modifiable) data types. Once a primitive data type is created we cannot modify it.

let number = 1;
let str = 'word';
let Booleans = true;
let emptyValue = null;
let variableWithoutValue = undefined;


// This expression does not change the string stored in the variable word. So, we can say that strings are not modifiable or in other words immutable. Primitive data types are compared by its values. Let us compare different data values. See the example below:
let numOne = 3
let numTwo = 3

console.log(numOne == numTwo)  

let js = 'JavaScript'
let py = 'Python'

console.log(js == py)            

let lightOn = true
let lightOff = false

console.log(lightOn == lightOff)
